# Weforecast
Weather Forecasting Tool: Create a command line tool that accepts a city's name and returns the current weather forecast. Leverage OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data and parse it using Python. Your solution should demonstrate how GitHub Copilot can help you with API usage, data parsing, and error handling.
# Github Copilot can be useful in:
Making API Requests:
Copilot can suggest the use of libraries like requests or http.client for making HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API.
It can provide code snippets for constructing the API endpoint URL with the required parameters, such as the city name and API key.

Handling API Responses:
Copilot can generate code for handling different types of API responses, including success and error cases.
It can suggest error handling logic to handle scenarios like invalid API responses, network errors, or rate limit exceeded.

Parsing JSON Data:
Copilot can assist in parsing the JSON response from the OpenWeatherMap API by suggesting code snippets for accessing specific data fields.
It can provide suggestions for navigating through the JSON structure and extracting relevant information such as temperature, weather description, or wind speed.

Error Handling:
Copilot can help generate code for handling errors, including exceptions, try-catch blocks, or error messages when API requests fail or responses are not as expected.
It can suggest error handling patterns for scenarios like invalid API keys, connection timeouts, or HTTP status codes indicating errors.
